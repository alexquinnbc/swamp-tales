        <!-- SCENE 1: THE PROMISE -->
        <section id="scene1">
            <h1 id="main-title">The Patriot & The Swamp</h1>
            <p>It began with a promise. A vow to shatter the corrupt D.C. establishment. When Donald Trump called, Elon Musk answered. He wasn't a politician. He was a builder, an innovator, a man who got things done. To a nation chanting "Drain the Swamp," he seemed like the perfect weapon.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SCENE 2: THE MANDATE -->
        <section id="scene2">
            <h2>The Mandate: DOGE</h2>
            <p>Musk was handed the reins of a new, powerful weapon: the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His mission was simple: cut the red tape, expose the grift, and bring private-sector accountability to a bloated government. It was a patriot's dream, a chance to fix a broken system from the inside.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SCENE 3: THE PURGE -->
        <section id="scene3">
            <h2 id="purge-title">The Purge Begins</h2>
            <p>But the swamp wasn't being drained. It was being re-engineered. While Musk was welcomed through the front door, the guard dogs were being quietly taken out the back. In the first days, the administration moved with brutal efficiency, not to eliminate waste, but to eliminate oversight.</p>
            <p>The first to go were the watchdogs: <span class="interactive" data-victim="ig">18 Inspectors General</span>. Then, the <span class="interactive" data-victim="osc">Head of the Office of Special Counsel</span>, the man who protects whistleblowers. The <span class="interactive" data-victim="oge">Head of the Office of Government Ethics</span> followed. The message was clear: no one is watching.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- SCENE 4: THE FALLOUT -->
        <section id="scene4">
            <h2 id="fallout-title">Collateral Damage</h2>
            <p>As DOGE began its work, a pattern emerged. The agencies being "reformed" were the ones investigating the administration's new friends. This wasn't about efficiency; it was about impunity.</p>
            <p>The <span class="interactive" data-victim="eeoc">leaders of the EEOC</span>, who were suing Tesla, were fired. <span class="interactive" data-victim="wilcox">Gwen Wilcox</span>, the NLRB Chair who dared file a complaint against SpaceX, was illegally terminated. <span class="interactive" data-victim="fda">FDA staffers</span> reviewing Neuralink suddenly found themselves jobless. An entire office at the <span class="interactive" data-victim="dol">Department of Labor</span> investigating Musk's companies was gutted.</p>
            <p>Each firing was a message. Each termination, a gift to a political ally.</p>
        </section>
        
        <!-- SCENE 5: THE BETRAYAL -->
        <section id="scene5">
            <h2 id="betrayal-title">The Swamp Fights Back</h2>
            <p>Musk, ever the engineer, saw the flaws in the machine. He began to speak out, offering criticism, believing he was a partner. He was wrong. In this Washington, there is no room for dissent, only fealty. The system he helped empower now turned on him.</p>
            <p>Regulators at the <span class="interactive" data-victim="nhtsa">NHTSA</span>, a "thorn in Tesla's side," were targeted. The <span class="interactive" data-victim="faa">FAA administrator</span> who fined SpaceX was pressured to resign. The patriot had become a liability. On Day 100, he was persona non grata, cast out of the very swamp he was meant to drain.</p>
        </section>
        
        <!-- SCENE 6: THE AUTOPSY -->
        <section id="scene6">
            <h2 id="autopsy-title">An Autopsy of Corruption</h2>
            <p><strong>BETRAYAL:</strong> The promise to "Drain the Swamp" was betrayed, replaced by a system of monetizing public office for political allies and personal gain.</p>
            <p><strong>POWER:</strong> The unchecked power of the executive branch was used to fire, intimidate, and reward, dismantling the government's own immune system.</p>
            <p><strong>CONSEQUENCE:</strong> The price was paid not by the powerful, but by public servants who did their jobs and by the American people they served.</p>
            <p class="final-thought">The patriot walked away. The swamp remains.</p>
